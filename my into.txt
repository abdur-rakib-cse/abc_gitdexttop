Hi, I am Abdur Rakib. I am a student of Daffodil International University. I measure in computer science and Engineering. Now I am in the 10th semester. My future plan is to be a Software Developer. My Home district is Joypurhat. I completed my secondary School Certificate from Joypurhat zela school with a GPA of 5.00 out of 5.00 and completed my Higher School Certificate From Joypurhat Govt College with a GPA of 4.00 out of 5.00. I like to read detective books and thriller categorical books and movies. I am studying detective through online resources. I am a straightforward and quiet person. I always try to stay formal in every situation. That's all about me. Thanks a lot for listening to my speech, and also thanks for giving me the opportunity. I wish to my God for everyone to stay always happy. Assalamu alaikum.
